# Solana Testing with poc_framework
Here are some examples, using poc_framework to test Solana smart contracts in Remote Environment and Local Environment.
You might find some unused code in the PoCs, but I've left it as a "skeleton".

The code was forked from these repositories:
- https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples/
